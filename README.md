# DTSA 5301 - Data Science as a Field
## Course assignment
This is my submission to the Week 3 assignment of the course.
It is also the first part of the final course project on Week 5.

The data source is known to everyone who migh be looking at this repository (most likely to assess my work), 
so I'll just mention that I made a local copy of the data, but the R Markdown file also works with the the URL of the original data set.

There is nothing to be updated in the Rmd file, you should be able to run it after installing the required packages:
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- lubridate

Thanks for taking the time to assess my project and good luck with yours!
